<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Jordi Cerdà-Bautista, a PhD candidate at the Image Processing Laboratory (IPL) at the Universitat de València. My research lies at the intersection of causal machine learning, climate systems, and development economics—specifically, understanding how climate variability, conflict, and market dynamics shape food security outcomes in Africa.</p>
