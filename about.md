<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a PhD candidate at the Image Processing Laboratory (IPL) at the Universitat de València. My research lies at the intersection of causal machine learning, climate systems, and development economics—specifically, understanding how climate variability, conflict, and market dynamics shape food security outcomes in Africa.</p>
  
<p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the Universitat de València, where I explored the fundamentals of wave phenomena in my undergraduate thesis on spatial coherence and polarization. During this time, I also studied abroad at the Università degli Studi di Torino (Italy) through the Erasmus program. Later, I pursued a Master’s in Data Science at the Universitat de València. I focused on deep learning methods for atmospheric correction of satellite imagery, applying machine learning to environmental data from space.</p>
